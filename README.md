# pleb-wallet is a web browser Bitcoin wallet using LNBits.
Designed by AustinKelsay, it is the end result of [PlebDev Course 1](https://www.pleblab.com/course).

Thanks to [Austin](https://github.com/AustinKelsay), [supertestnet](https://github.com/supertestnet), and [PlebLab](https://github.com/PlebLab/main) for the fun overview of the modern webdev stack.

I'll be adding my own touches to this code to learn more about web development.

# **(FUNDS ARE NOT SAFU)**
Do not store any amount of bitcoin you do not wish to lose on this wallet!
